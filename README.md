# Roman Numerals

### Font
Comfortaaa Bold, 325px
Bright green color (so that you can select by color to delete later)
Letter spacing: 30
Box: Dynamic

Use the perspective tool and align each corner with the corners on the gray rounded box. Zoom way in so that you're right on the corners. Once you like the way it looks, scale it down a bit and adjust it so it looks centered. 


# Year
### Font
Comfortaa Bold, 250px
Dark red color (select using the color picker tool that looks like the eyedropper)
Letter spacing: 30
Box: Dynamic


Use the perspective tool and align each corner with the corners on the gray rounded box (yes, on top of the roman numerals). Zoom way in so that you're right on the corners. Once you like the way it looks, scale it down and place it where the year goes (above the C in WSUCON)
